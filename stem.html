	<h1>Robyn Sue Fisher</h1>
	<h3>By Kinnari Atluru</h3>
<p>Robyn Sue Fisher is the founder of Smitten's Icecream, a very succesful icecream business in San Francisco. Back in 2009, two years before she would open her first retail location, Fisher’s business basically consisted of an ice cream machine powered by an old motorcycle battery that she had rewired and reconfigured. She placed the jerry-rigged contraption on top of a milk crate, which was then bungee-corded to a Radio Flyer wagon outfitted with off-road wheels. A cooler held the day’s fresh ingredients, and a tank of liquid nitrogen, which can flash-freeze food, enabled her to churn out ice cream on the spot. To make the base of her inaugural flavor— caramel, offered with or without sea salt—she was up until 2AM cooking the syrupy substance in her studio apartment. She spent countless hours squeezing citrus for the Meyer lemon flavor and scoured the farmers market for peppers to spice up her chocolate ice cream.</p>
